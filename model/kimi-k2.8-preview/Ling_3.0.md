## Model card
- **Name:** Kimi K2.8 Preview
- **Short description:** Moonshot AI's mid-tier coding and agentic checkpoint, positioned between K2.7 Code and the flagship K3, with near-flagship performance at more efficient thinking.
- **Provider / access:** Moonshot AI — `kimi-for-coding` alias in Kimi Code; not available on open platform API; membership tiers (all tiers get 1M context)
- **Release / knowledge:** September 11, 2026; knowledge cutoff not separately published
- **IDs:** moonshotai/kimi-k2.8-preview
- **Context window:** 1,048,576 tokens (1M; available on all membership tiers)
- **Modalities:** Images and video in; text out (thinking mode adjustable at low/high/max)
- **Pricing (as of 2026-09-23):** Not publicly listed on open platform; membership-based via Kimi Code; estimated ~$2.85/$14.25 per Mtok (LLM Stats third-party)
- **Architecture:** Parameter count undisclosed; Moonshot describes performance as "close to K3" with more efficient thinking than K2.7 Code; no open weights published

### Raw benchmarks found
Agent / tool use:
- No independently published benchmark table for K2.8 Preview specifically
- Moonshot reports coding and agent capability improved across the board relative to K2.7 Code (company-reported only)
- K2.7 Code predecessor: Terminal-Bench 2.0 66.7%, SWE-bench Pro 58.6%, Terminal-Bench 2.1 53.6%

Reasoning / knowledge:
- No independently published benchmark table for K2.8 Preview specifically
- Kimi K3 (flagship predecessor): GPQA Diamond 91.2%, HLE 58.7%, AIME 2026 96.7%
- Moonshot claims overall performance "close to K3"

Coding:
- No independently published benchmark table for K2.8 Preview specifically
- Kimi K3 (flagship predecessor): SWE-bench Pro 63.4%, Terminal-Bench 2.0 71.8%, LiveCodeBench v6 89.6%
- K2.6 (earlier coding model): SWE-bench Pro 58.6%, LiveCodeBench v6 89.6%, SWE-bench Verified 80.2%

Long context:
- 1M token context window available on all membership tiers
- No independent long-context recall benchmark published for this checkpoint

### Normalized scores (1-100)
- **Tool use: 69/100.** No independently verified benchmark data for K2.8 Preview; estimated from predecessor K2.7 Code's Terminal-Bench 2.0 at 66.7% and Toolathlon at 50.0%; Moonshot claims coding and agent improvement but provides no quantitative comparison; limited independent verification available.
- **Reasoning: 80/100.** No independently verified benchmark data for K2.8 Preview; estimated from Kimi K3's GPQA Diamond at 91.2% and HLE at 58.7%; Moonshot's claim of "close to K3" suggests strong reasoning capability; AIME 2026 performance likely strong based on family lineage.
- **Context window: 95/100.** Full 1M-token context window available on all membership tiers, a significant upgrade from K2.7 Code's 262K; ultra-long context democratized across all plan tiers.
- **Multimodal: 75/100.** Images and video input supported matching K3's multimodal path; no native audio input; multimodal benchmarks not separately published for this checkpoint; family-level multimodal capability inferred from K3.
- **Coding: 75/100.** No independently verified benchmark data for K2.8 Preview; estimated from Kimi K3's SWE-bench Pro at 63.4%, Terminal-Bench 2.0 at 71.8%, and LiveCodeBench at 89.6%; Moonshot claims near-flagship coding performance; K2.6's SWE-bench Pro at 58.6% provides a floor estimate.
- **Cost efficiency: 85/100.** Membership-based pricing not publicly confirmed; estimated competitive with K2.6's $0.95/$4.00 per Mtok; the model is positioned as a cost-effective alternative to K3's higher-tier membership requirements.
- **Overall Score: 79/100.** Estimated scores based on predecessor data and Moonshot's qualitative claims; strong context (95), good reasoning (80), and coding (75) are the pillars; tool use (69) and multimodal (75) are moderate; cost efficiency (85) is favorable; cost efficiency excluded from Overall per methodology.
