### Normalized scores (1–100)

- **Tool use: 35/100.** No verified tool-use evidence for the 1.5 tier.
- **Reasoning: 40/100.** No verified public score found -> low band; small coding model.
- **Context window: 50/100.** No verified context measurement.
- **Multimodal: 15/100.** Text-only.
- **Coding: 35/100.** No verified coding score for the 1.5 tier.
- **Cost efficiency: 90/100.** Not verified.

- **Overall Score: 35/100.** Mean of the five quality dims: (35 + 40 + 50 + 15 + 35) / 5 = 35 (half-up); Cost efficiency excluded from the mean.
