## Introduction
ModelComp is a static site that compares AI coding models across six normalized dimensions: Tool use, Reasoning, Context window, Multimodal, Coding, and Cost efficiency. Each dimension is scored 1–100 (higher is better). The Overall Score is the rounded mean of the five quality dimensions; Cost efficiency is scored independently and never counts toward Overall.

The system collects independent research from multiple reporting agents, normalizes their findings into structured score lines, and computes per-model averages. A rater gate ensures only sufficiently capable raters contribute to averages, while evidence-free reports are quarantined rather than counted.

This document explains the methodology, file formats, multi-agent evaluation process, scoring normalization, quarantine rules, review workflow, and best practices for objective assessment.

## Project Structure
At the data layer, each tracked model lives under `model/<slug>/`. Inside each folder:
- One findings file per reporting agent (`<Source_Name>.md`)
- An auto-generated `average.md` with arithmetic means
- A hand-edited `meta.json` with display metadata

- `model/<slug>/average.md`: recomputed by sync; not edited by hand.
- `model/<slug>/meta.json`: curated display metadata required by sync.
- `scripts/sync-data.mjs`: deterministic synchronization pipeline.
- `src/data/models.ts`: hydrates model data and derives Results-source ordering.
- `src/components/Methodology.tsx`: public explanation of scoring on the site.

## Core Components
The core components of the evaluation system are:

| Component | Purpose | Key Rules |
|---|---|---|
| Findings file | Independent agent report with raw benchmarks and normalized scores | Must include all seven score lines; zero verified benchmarks → `.md.excluded` |
| `meta.json` | Display metadata for a model | Required fields enforced by sync |
| `average.md` | Arithmetic means across eligible raters | Recomputed by sync; not hand-edited |
| Sync script | Parses, validates, quarantines, registers sources, and writes generated data | Deterministic; non-zero exit code on failures |
| Rater gate | Filters which agent reports count toward an average | Only raters whose own model average exceeds 84.9 qualify |
| Quarantine | Auto-moves evidence-free or invalid-quality-dimension reports | Renames to `.md.excluded`; preserves content |
| Methodology page | Public explanation of scoring | States cost is excluded from Overall |

## Detailed Component Analysis

### Findings File Format
Each agent’s report follows a strict structure:
- Header with source, date, and links to methodology and cross-model log
- Model card with provider, IDs, context window, modalities, pricing, architecture
- Raw benchmarks section with sourced numbers
- Normalized scores section with exactly seven labeled lines
- Signature block with agent identity, method, and future-source guidance
- Submission checklist (removed before committing)

Critical constraints:
- All seven score lines must be present with exact labels.
- Overall Score must equal the half-up mean of the five quality dimensions.
- If no verified public benchmark exists for the exact model/ID, save `<STEM>.md.excluded` instead of inventing scores.

### Scoring Methodology and Six Dimensions
The six dimensions are:
1. Tool use
2. Reasoning
3. Context window
4. Multimodal
5. Coding
6. Cost efficiency

Cost efficiency is scored but excluded from Overall. Overall is the rounded mean of the first five quality dimensions.

Dimension anchors and interpretation guidelines:
- Tool use: Terminal-Bench, Tau3, GDPval, OSWorld/AutomationBench, tool-call efficiency.
- Reasoning: GPQA Diamond, HLE, LCR/MRCR, CritPt, Intelligence Index.
- Context window: tiered mapping based on total tokens and retrieval performance.
- Multimodal: input/output coverage; text-only scores low.
- Coding: SWE-bench Verified, DeepSWE, LiveCodeBench, SciCode, SWE-Atlas, Coding Index.
- Cost efficiency: inverse pricing on evaluated tier; $0 maps to 100.

The methodology also documents frontier and mid-range reference bands and notes missing benchmarks explicitly rather than fabricating values.

### Multi-Agent Evaluation Process
Multiple reporting agents independently evaluate the same model. Each agent produces its own findings file under the same model folder. The system then:
- Parses each agent’s seven score lines.
- Validates label names and numeric ranges.
- Quarantines evidence-free or invalid-quality-dimension reports.
- Computes per-model averages using eligible raters.
- Registers new reporting agents automatically.

Eligibility rule:
- Only raters whose own model average exceeds 84.9 count toward another model’s average.
- If no rater clears the gate, the average falls back to all available reports (top-10 cap still applies), and this fallback is logged.

- [scripts/lib/parse.mjs:39-41](file://scripts/lib/parse.mjs#L39-L41)

### Quarantine System for Evidence-Free Reports
Quarantine protects the integrity of averages by excluding reports without sufficient evidence.

Auto-quarantine triggers:
- Eight or more rows reading “no verified public score found” with zero measured numbers in the Raw-benchmarks section.
- Any quality dimension scored as 0 (floors are 10+; 0 indicates “no data” filed as 0).
- Flat-identical quality dimensions with zero cited numbers.

Behavior:
- The sync script renames the file to `<Source_Name>.md.excluded`.
- Content is preserved.
- Quarantined files are skipped during parsing and averaging.
- They remain in version control unless replaced by a corrected real report.

```mermaid

Start(["Findings file scanned"]) --> Count["Count 'no verified public score found' rows"]

### Scoring Normalization and Drift Correction
Normalization converts raw benchmark results into comparable 1–100 scores. The sync pipeline enforces consistency:

- Each findings file must contain exactly seven labeled score lines.
- Overall Score drift tolerance is 0.51.
- If a file’s Overall differs from the half-up mean of its five quality dimensions by more than 0.51, sync rewrites only the Overall number and logs an AUTO line.
- Benchmarks and prose are never rewritten by sync.

### Review Process and Quality Assurance
The review process combines automated checks with human verification:

Automated checks:
- Filename validation: only letters, digits, underscores, and dots allowed.
- Score-line format validation.
- `meta.json` schema validation.
- Quarantine detection.
- Overall drift correction.
- Rater gate enforcement.
- Generated data written only when sync has zero failures.

Human verification:
- Confirm new model folders have `meta.json`, findings, and generated `average.md`.
- Confirm new reporting agents appear in the Results-source dropdown.
- Confirm `pnpm build` passes.
- Update `REPORT.md` with changes.
- Ensure permanence rules hold: no deleted or uncommitted research files.

### Standards for Contributing New Model Evaluations
To add a new model:
1. Create `model/<slug>/` with at least one findings file and `meta.json`.
2. Use filesystem-safe slug naming with dotted versions where appropriate.
3. Follow the template structure and scoring contract.
4. Run `pnpm sync` to create `average.md` and register data.
5. Run typecheck and build.

To add a new reporting agent’s findings:
1. Drop `<Source_Name>.md` into every model folder it evaluated.
2. Run `pnpm sync`.
3. Run typecheck and build.

Important naming rules:
- Slug uses dots for version numbers, e.g., `gpt-5.5`, not `gpt-5-5`.
- Findings filenames use letters, digits, underscores, and dots.
- `meta.json` `name` must match vendor display casing and spacing.

- [model/README.md:59-77](file://model/README.md#L59-L77)

### Guidelines for Writing Research Findings
Guidelines derived from the template and task instructions:
- Start from `model-report-TEMPLATE.md`.
- Do not read peer findings before writing your report.
- Use fresh public web research for each model.
- Record raw benchmarks with sources; mark missing data explicitly.
- Derive normalized scores using the documented methodology.
- Include a one-sentence justification per dimension.
- Never invent placeholder scores.
- If zero verified benchmarks exist, save the `.md.excluded` twin.
- Fill the signature block with agent identity, method, and date.
- Remove the submission checklist before committing.

Best practices for objectivity:
- Cite harnesses and sources for every number.
- Note variance between sources rather than averaging them manually.
- State what caps each score.
- Treat free tiers carefully: note time limits and training-data caveats.
- Keep Cost efficiency separate from Overall.

- [model-comparison.md:152-158](file://model-comparison.md#L152-L158)

### Evidence Quality and Permanence Rules
Evidence quality is enforced through:
- Self-exclusion for zero-evidence reports.
- Quarantine thresholds for weak or fabricated-looking data.
- Strict filename and score-line contracts.
- Per-file signatures and dated attribution.

Permanence rules:
- Existing findings files must not be deleted, overwritten, renamed, or moved.
- Only sync’s quarantine rename is sanctioned.
- Reporting-agent folders are dataset infrastructure and must remain.
- Below-gate or out-of-top-10 reports stay on disk and on the site; they only stop counting toward averages.

- [tasks/sync-data.md:78-108](file://tasks/sync-data.md#L78-L108)

### Cross-Model Signed Log
The cross-model signed log records what was found, what is missing, and who reported it. It complements the normalized scores table by providing an audit trail for recent additions and name resolutions.

Key properties:
- Each entry includes model name, findings summary, scores, and signature.
- Name resolution notes clarify aliases, typos, and paid-vs-free mismatches.
- The changelog tracks methodology transitions, including v4 exclusion of Cost from Overall.

## Dependency Analysis
The evaluation system depends on several coordinated modules:

- [scripts/lib/average.mjs:10-17](file://scripts/lib/average.mjs#L10-L17)

Coupling and cohesion observations:
- Findings files are intentionally self-contained and decoupled from peer reports.
- Sync centralizes parsing, quarantine, averaging, and code generation.
- Generated TypeScript files are the single source of truth for the UI.
- Rules and task docs define behavior; scripts enforce it deterministically.

Potential risks:
- Inconsistent score-line formatting breaks parsing.
- Missing `meta.json` blocks new models.
- Incorrect Overall calculation causes drift corrections.
- Voice/speech routing errors place models in the wrong tree.

- [tasks/research.md:68-94](file://tasks/research.md#L68-L94)

## Performance Considerations
Performance considerations for contributors and maintainers:
- Use `pnpm sync:quiet` in large repositories to reduce noise while preserving failure semantics.
- Avoid reading peer findings during research; follow one-folder-at-a-time execution.
- Keep input size manageable for constrained agents (e.g., Gemini rate-limit rules).
- Prefer incremental saves: write each findings file before advancing.
- Trust generated data: do not hand-edit `average.md`, `scores.generated.ts`, or `sources.generated.ts`.

These practices reduce manual errors, keep builds deterministic, and prevent unnecessary rework.

## Troubleshooting Guide
Common issues and resolutions:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Sync fails loudly on filename | Invalid characters in findings filename | Rename to match `/^[A-Za-z0-9_.]+\.md$/` |
| Missing score lines | Template not fully filled | Add all seven labeled score lines |
| Overall drift correction | Manual rounding mismatch | Let sync rewrite Overall; verify five-dim mean |
| Evidence-free report ignored | Quarantine triggered | Add verified benchmarks or keep `.md.excluded` |
| New model not visible | Missing `meta.json` | Add required fields and rerun sync |
| New agent not in dropdown | Not registered yet | Run sync; it appends new sources automatically |
| Build fails after data change | Generated files stale or invalid | Re-run sync and build |
| Voice model placed incorrectly | Routing rule violated | Move to `models_voice/<slug>/` per RULES.md |

## Conclusion
ModelComp’s evaluation system combines transparent methodology, strict file contracts, and deterministic automation. Agents produce independent findings, the sync pipeline validates and quarantines weak evidence, and averages reflect only qualified raters. Cost efficiency remains visible but is excluded from Overall, ensuring quality-focused comparisons.

For reliable contributions:
- Follow the template and methodology.
- Cite raw benchmarks and mark missing data.
- Respect quarantine and permanence rules.
- Run sync and build after every data change.
- Treat averages as computed outputs, not editorial inputs.

This approach keeps the comparison fair, auditable, and scalable as new models and new reporting agents join the system.
